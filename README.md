##
I am a self-taught Data Engineer who has been working in the Water Infrastructure industry for 5 years. I was always interested in programming, but never had any formal training. My love of learning and curiosity about how things work led me to find ways of teaching myself new skills on my own time. I was still interested in learning the field so I started doing some machine learning on my own. I loved learning about machine learning and I decided to take it seriously and get into data science more seriously.

The Mathematics and Statistics was the first class I took and it really got me interested in learning more about data science which has been my passion for quite some time now so naturally it made sense to take their course. It helped put me on track to be where I am today. These courses really helped me learn the fundamentals of data science and how to apply them. I was able to see what other people were working on, how they approached problems.

I started doing projects for myself to help build up my portfolio. This way employers would know I was capable of learning new things on my own and that I had experience with machine learning or data science related topics even if I didnâ€™t have a degree .
